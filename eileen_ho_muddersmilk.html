      <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
      A specialty from Canton on the outer planet called Higgin’s Moon – where mud is a major export. Mudding’s hard work and this potable is sure to satisfy – all the protein, vitamins and carbs of your grandma’s best turkey dinner. The ancient Egyptians, back on Earth-That-Was used a similar form of beer that they fed the slaves to build their pyramids. It’s liquid bread. Kept them from starving and knocked them out at night so they wouldn’t be inclined to insurrection. Jayne is a fan of the concoction but it is definitely not to Wash’s liking. In Canton is appropriate to raise a toast to the Mudders before downing a glass.
